The PTP Daemon is known to work on FreeBSD and Linux systems.

*) Building on FreeBSD

1) cd into the src/ directory
2) Un comment the #-DBSD_INTERFACE_FUNCTIONS option:

Turn this:
CFLAGS = -Wall #-DBSD_INTERFACE_FUNCTIONS

into this:
CFLAGS = -Wall -DBSD_INTERFACE_FUNCTIONS

3) Run "make"
4) Read the manual page.
5) Test it in place: ./ptpd -your -arguments -here
6) Run "make install"

*) Building on Linux

Follow the steps above except for step number 2.

The daemon may work on other Posix based systems but this is not
guaranteed.  Patches and fixes are welcome on the source forge page
